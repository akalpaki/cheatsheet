# Cheat-sheet app

_____________________________

This is going to be a simple cheat-sheet creator. The current design goals for this app are:

- Create a fully functioning **RESTful API** which will use a **POSTGRES-SQL** server to store the cheat-sheets and user info and a **Tailwind-CSS** frontend.
- Intended user experience: 

	 1. You can create your own cheat-sheets, which will contain information you find useful to remember while doing tasks (ie. cooking recipes, code hints, or anything else you might find useful to have at the tip of your fingers.)
	 2. You have a choice between a public or private mode for your cheat-sheets, allowing you to choose if you wish to share the sheets your create with other users, who may find your way of explaining or organizing information useful.

This app is being created in the process of me learning how to program using `Python` and `Flask`. If you do happen to stumble across this and you're horrified by my terrible code, I humbly apologize and suggest using this [eyebleach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tcx6YyXvvRI).
